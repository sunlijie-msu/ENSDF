 35S  c  1977Ab07: A vector-polarized 11.8-MeV deuteron beam was produced from  
 35S 2c  the University of Wisconsin Lamb-shift polarized ion source and tandem 
 35S 3c  accelerator. The target was a 90% enriched {+34}S, 610-|mg/cm{+2}      
 35S 4c  thick, evaporated onto a 100-|mg/cm{+2} gold foil and covered by a     
 35S 5c  50-|mg/cm{+2} gold layer. The reaction products were detected using    
 35S 6c  four |DE-E counter telescopes of freon-cooled surface-barrier and      
 35S 7c  Si(Li) detectors with FWHM|?60 keV. Measured angular distributions of  
 35S 8c  cross sections |s(E{-p},|q) and angular distributions of analyzing     
 35S 9c  powers iT{-11}(E{-p},|q). Deduced levels, J, |p, L-transfers, and
