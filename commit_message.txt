S35 resonance data PNG extraction and file corruption prevention

Summary:
- Completed systematic extraction of three types of nuclear resonance parameters from PNG images
- Implemented comprehensive file corruption prevention protocols for safe ENSDF editing
- Enhanced scientific content accuracy and formatting consistency in S35 resonance files

ENSDF Scientific Content:
- S35_ng_resonances.ens: Complete format conversion from scattered data to standard ENSDF L-record structure
  * Converted 315 lines to 160 lines with proper neutron energy format
  * Extracted gΓnΓγ/Γ values from PNG tables with meV→eV conversion (2 corrections)
  * Extracted gΓn values from PNG tables (8 new comment lines, 2 corrections)
  * Extracted Γγ values from PNG tables with semicolon separator format (8 additions)
  * Enhanced experimental description: "Deduced 81 resonances" specification
  * Updated fictitious level comment: |G{-|g}=0.38 eV correction
- S35_ng_E_thermal.ens: Header updates for ENSDF 202509 consistency

Safety Enhancements:
- copilot-instructions.md: Added comprehensive file corruption prevention protocols
  * Immediate stop conditions for structure corruption detection
  * Mandatory safeguards: single field edits, precise context matching
  * Detailed editing safety protocol with correct vs incorrect examples
  * File corruption recovery procedures

Processing Artifacts:
- PNG files: Added 2018MuZY_35S resonance data tables and processing files
  * Original PNG images and Photoshop processing files (8.8MB each)
  * Multiple cropped versions for clear visibility of different data columns
  * Cross-verification against original images to prevent data hallucination

Files changed: 3 modified, 10 untracked
Completion of systematic PNG data extraction project with enhanced safety protocols for future ENSDF editing operations.
